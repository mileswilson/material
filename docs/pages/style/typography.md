# Typography
Too many type sizes and styles at once can wreck any layout. A typographic scale has a limited set of type sizes that work well together along with the layout grid.

* Display 4
* Display 3
* Display 2
* Display 1
* Headline
* Title
* Subheading 2
* Subheading 1
* Body 2
* Body 1
* Caption
* Button

# Usage

```html
<body class="md-typography">
  <h1 class="display4">Big heading</h1>
</body>
```

# Installation
The Roboto font will not be automatically loaded. The developer is responsible for loading all fonts used in their application. The Roboto Font has a few easy ways to get started:

## Roboto Font CDN
Shown below is a sample link markup used to load the Roboto font from a CDN.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500">
```

## Install with npm
You can install it by typing the below command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install typeface-roboto --save
```

Then, you can import it in your entrypoint.

### CSS Classes
If you want to set the typographic style of an element, which is not a Material Design component, you can apply the following CSS classes.

CSS Class | Description
